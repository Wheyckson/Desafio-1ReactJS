## :rocket: About the challenge

In this challenge, you must continue to develop the transaction management application, GoFinances. Now you will practice what you have learned so far in React.js along with TypeScript, using routes and sending files by form.

This will be an application that will connect to your [Challenge 06] backend (https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafios/tree/master/desafio-database-upload), and display the transactions created and allow importing a CSV file to generate new records in the database.
